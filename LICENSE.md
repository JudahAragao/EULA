To make a warranty claim, the User must contact Production Type through its Website. Claims must include a sales receipt and documentation of the issue.
4. **Disclaimers**
    1. Bearing in mind the highly technical nature of the Font, and the current status of IT techniques, the Parties mutually agree that Production Type is subject to an obligation of means, specifically not guaranteeing that the Font is fit for the User’s intended use.
    2. The liability of Production Type may only be incurred by its actions in the sole case where a causal link has been established between the alleged detriment and gross misconduct of Production Type, without prejudice to any applicable laws and regulations.
    3.

If the User acquires the Font for governmental usage, the User agrees to read and comply with all applicable rules relating to the purchase of a license, and its effective use.

## 8. Termination

1. **Termination for non-compliance** 
    1. The User guarantees Production Type against all representations or reproductions, particularly in the form of a copy, of the Font outside the framework of the Agreement, and acknowledges that he shall be solely liable in the event of representation, reproduction, or extraction of the Font, in particular by end-users who are not authorized to access the Font, and in the event of use in anything other than compiled executable form.
    2. The User must ensure that either the User Group, as well as any provider called upon to use the Font, are informed of the terms and conditions of the Agreement and that they agree to be bound by it before using the Font, to which the User agrees.
    3. During the Term of this Agreement, if Production Type so requests, the User is required to provide complete and accurate answers to Production Type’s questions concerning equipment in which he has installed the Font and uses to which the Font has been put, certified by an officer of the company. In addition, upon at least ten days’ advance notice, Production Type may, either through its employees or through a third party designated by Production Type, inspect the User’s records and equipment to verify compliance with the terms of the Agreement. Production Type will treat in confidence all information to which it has access in making an inspection, except as may be reasonable to enforce this Agreement. 
    4. This Agreement is subject to termination in Production Type’s sole discretion if the User violates any of the terms and conditions stated herein. Production Type may, but is not required to, suggest revised conditions of the Agreement on which the User may continue to use the Font after curing the violation in an appropriate manner. (For example, if the User failed to respect the Agreement’s “Number of employees” limitation, Production Type may require as a condition to continued use that the User expands the Agreement to unlimited employees so there will be no need for future oversight on this issue.)
    5. In addition to any damages the violation may cause Production Type, it will be entitled to payment by the User of the costs incurred by it to investigate and address the violation, enforce the License, and finalize a settlement, including reasonable bailiffs’, investigators’, and attorneys’ fees.

3. **Termination for convenience**
    1. The Parties may end the Agreement at any time, respecting a notice of three months following the sending of an email or a registered mail with acknowledgement of receipt.
    2. In this case, the User is not required to proceed with withdrawal of documents when such documents on tangible or physical media and using the Font or the Typeface have already been published, made available to the public, or distributed. The User is also authorized to use up existing stocks of such documents, published but not yet distributed before the termination date. It is, on the other hand, understood between the Parties that no re-publication using the Font or Typeface is authorized after the termination date.
4. **Consequences common to all types of terminations** In case of termination of this Agreement, the stipulations of Articles 1, 5, 7, 8, 9, and 11 remain applicable. No fees will be refundable to the User upon termination. Within no more than thirty days of the termination date of the Agreement, the User must immediately:

    2. Delete the Font and the copies thereof, from all servers, computers, devices, and more generally any storage space on which the Font is stored.

## 9. Assignment

1. This Agreement is personal, and the User may not assign it or transfer it to a third party, without prejudice to the cases expressly set out in Article 2 and the Addenda herein, where the use of the Font by a third party is authorized, subject to respect for the conditions and purpose of this use.
2. If the Font is validly assigned by the User to a third party according to law, said assignment shall only be valid and enforceable against Production Type as long as the User informs Production Type of the full identity and details of the assignee of the Font, as requested by Production Type, and the User provides evidence to Productions Type of the destruction of all copies of the Font held by the initial user.
3. At any time, Production Type may assign the obligations springing from this Agreement to the person or legal entity of its choice.

3. If one or several stipulations of the Agreement are held to be invalid or declared as such according to law, regulations, or following a definitive ruling by a competent court, the other stipulations shall retain all their force and scope.

The User expressly agrees that the United Nations Convention on Agreements for International Sales of Goods is hereby excluded. 

## 11. General 

1. **License upgrade.** To obtain a license upgrade, the User must contact Production Type for further information. If the User is not sure that the use he intends to make of the Font is authorized, he must contact Production Type for verification. The absence of a request for authorization by the User or the absence of any specific prohibition in the Agreement may not be interpreted as an authorization or authorized usage under any circumstance whatsoever. The fact of not requiring or forcing the execution by the User of certain stipulations herein, or the fact of not prevailing upon a right set out herein, cannot be interpreted as a waiver, by Production Type, of its right to require or impose the execution of these stipulations. The express waiver by Production Type of stipulations, conditions, or requirements in this Agreement may not constitute a waiver of any future obligation of compliance with said stipulations, conditions, or requirements. 
2. **License Agreement updates.** Production Type reserves the right to amend or modify the Agreement at any moment without notice, in particular for future technical developments insofar as any provisions herein are rendered obsolete or incomplete by new or changed technology. The user may be informed by any means of the new stipulations of this Agreement, effective as of the date of publication of notice of the modification on Production Type’s Website.
3. **License normalization.** In the event of multiple license purchases over time by the User, if there are any differences in the terms between or among the Agreements issued in connection with the purchases, Production Type has the right to require that the terms in the latest Agreement govern the entirety of the User’s licensed uses of all Fonts supplied to the User. Production Type may also impose consistent Agreement terms on any related entities (such as foreign affiliates or franchisees) that place orders for the same Font.
4. **Digital rights management.** According to articles L.131-9, L.331-5, L.331-11 of the French intellectual property code, Production Type can resort to technical measures and systems to protect the Font, or to control its use. The User may not take measures aimed at misappropriating or infringing those technical measures. The User expressly recognizes and accepts that those technical measures may limit or revoke his access and use of the Font. The User also agrees to the automatic updating of those technical measures, and the associated consequences. It is expressly agreed between the Parties that this specific commitment constitutes an essential and determinant obligation without which Production Type would not conclude the Agreement.

# Addenda - License types

## A. Trial 

1. The User is authorized to install the Font exclusively for testing, evaluating, comping, or presentation purposes, for instance to a client of the User. “Install” means making the font locally available to applications on a device.
2. The User is thus authorized to create artwork using the Typeface exclusively for private and internal tests, prospective presentations to clients, for evaluating the technical compatibility of the Font, and for evaluating the aesthetical characteristics of the Typeface.
3. Any public or private production use, commercial or non-commercial, is hereby excluded, in particular the exploitation and dissemination of images or graphics showing the Typeface, of websites referring the Font in their code or rendering text styled with the Typeface, and of websites displaying images or graphics showing the Typeface.
4. In order to use the Font in final work, or publish it, or otherwise render it public, the User and, if so applies, his client must have a non-trial license and any addenda that may apply to the use.
5. The Font under this Trial license is provided on an ‘as is’ basis without any warranties of any kind, and Production Type’s guarantee as stipulated in 7.3 and 7.4 does not apply.

## B. Desktop

1. The User is authorized to install the Font for internal business use. “Install” means making the font locally available to applications on a device.
2. The User is authorized to install the Font for a defined number of sub-users as described in the Purchase Order (“User Group”). It is specified that when the User is a legal entity, the User Group must all be employees of the company to which the Agreement is granted. The Addenda fee is based upon the cumulated Number of Employees specified in the Purchase Order (across all geographical sites, measured over one year).
3. By “Desktop” is meant use of the Font on a tangible media, enabling editing by the User alone, then the display and printing of human-readable text on a tangible media, internally or as part of the User’s commercial activity, and as an accessory to this activity, to the exclusion of any use expressly granted in other Licenses types and of any commercial use of the Font or the Typeface themselves. 
4. The Font may thus be used for the design and publication of printed graphics and static images, such as books, brochures, catalogs; more generally, as part of literary and media publishing activity in which the Typeface may appear in a non-editable, non-embedded form. The Font may be used to create non-font static digital documents such as bitmap images on the web, and non-font vector images. 
5. The use of the Font is authorized for static text only, not dynamic. Use for dynamic text editable by a third party or the displaying and printing of variable data is not part of this License. The dynamic display of the Typeface, and the dynamic rasterizing and rendering of the Typeface as bitmap images, is not authorized either.

The User is obliged to inform any such commercial printer, pre­press or service company about the content and restrictions of this Agreement, including the prohibition against reproducing, distributing, providing to the public, disseminating, executing or more generally exploiting in any way, free or at cost, the Font. Copies of the Font shall be deleted immediately after performing the service. For greater certainty, it is specified that if the User is a service provider and downloads the Font for his own use, the license granted does not cover the use of the Font for any of the User’s customers. The User’s customer must acquire a license as applicable.
7. **Addenda to article 3.6 “Embed”:** For the exclusive purpose of outputting certain files, the User is permitted to embed the Font in digital documents only when intended for printing. The user recognizes that the transmission of a document in PDF file format set to “printing and viewing only” is the first and best method for transmitting documents to a service bureau or printer. All other provisions of article 3.6 remain in force, especially pertaining to the unauthorized distribution of digital documents where the Font is embedded. This special authorization is without prejudice to respect by the User of the obligations set out herein, and particularly this Addenda and Article 8. 
8. The User may install and use the Font in standalone desktop design software that relies on a remote cloud server infrastructure and has a desktop interface, both conditions being cumulative. The User may install the Font on 1 (one) local file server such as a network font manager, for use on a local network (LAN), solely in the case where use of the Font is expressly limited to the total number of sub-users that may install the Font under this Agreement, corresponding to the total number of persons that may have access to the Font at any moment.

If a brand is identified in the Purchase Order, the domains must be substantially dedicated to the licensed brand, and the brand must be prominently displayed and identified on the domains (or, if there are multiple brands, they are all owned by the User, and the Font is used only for the licensed brand). The User may not install the Font in any manner whatsoever. “Install” means making the font locally available to applications on a device.
2. **Addenda to article 3.6 “Embed”:** The user may embed the Font in a website to render text in HTML pages via the @font-face CSS command, and may copy the Font in databases produced by the User. It is specified that the reproduction of the Font is only authorized here to the extent that it is the necessary accessory to the use of the Font and its execution to generate websites pages using the Font, and the consultation and editing of text by website visitors of said website pages using the Font.
3. **Addenda to article 3.2 “Copy”:** For the exclusive purpose of previewing certain files, the User is permitted to transfer a copy of the Font used for previewing the relevant file, to web developers and web agencies, on the condition that there will be no active use of the Font (for example, but not limited to: for text formatting, editing, or corrections). In the event of active use of the Font, such service companies are required to purchase their own license. The User is obliged to inform any such web developer, web agency or service company about the content and restrictions of this Agreement, including the prohibition against reproducing, distributing, providing to the public, disseminating, executing or more generally exploiting in any way, free or at cost, the Font. Copies of the Font shall be deleted immediately after performing the service. For greater certainty, it is specified that if the User is a service provider and downloads the Font for his own use, the license granted does not cover the use of the Font for any of the User’s customers. The User’s customer must acquire a license as applicable. The User is permitted to transfer a copy of the Font to a provider supplying remote storage services (remote servers, cloud, and other similar services) to the User, as part of a web use requiring the remote execution of the Font, it being specified that the Font format may not be modified, and that only the copy of the executable version of the Font, as provided by Production Type, is authorized. The Font must not be supplied in a format that enables extraction. If the correct functioning of the website created by the User requires the storage of the Font in a remote storage space, in a format that enables the extraction, editing, alteration, enrichment, or modification of the Font by a third party, the user undertakes to inform the provider of the need to prevent any extraction, reproduction, or representation of the Font, and all reproductions other than those strictly necessary for the operation of the website. The User shall undertake measures to prevent the copy or extraction of the Font, and in particular the linking to the Font from unauthorized websites and domain names outside of the Purchase Order.

To further clarify, the use of the Font to generate static documents (e.g. variable data printing, automatic PDF generation, or print-on-demand products) is not authorized. Use in banners, pop-up advertising, email newsletters, and HTML5 ads on third parties web servers and websites is not authorized.
